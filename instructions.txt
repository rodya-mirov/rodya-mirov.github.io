To ADD A NEW PAGE, there are two steps.
	FIRST, add your tab to the "content_list.txt" in the content folder;
	the first token is the id of the tab (make sure it's not the same as
	any other id, and has no special characters).  The rest of the tokens
	will be sanitized and combined into the *visible* name of the tab.
	LaTeX and other special characters are fine here.

	SECOND, add a new html file, where the id is the same as your
	filename.  If that doesn't make sense, look at the existing html
	files and get the trend.  Try to imitate their style as well,
	for a coherent look.

To FIDDLE with content on an existing page, just open up the .html file
in the content folder, add things, subtract things, fix LaTeX bugs, or
whatever.  Then save it.  This needs to take place in the DROPBOX folder,
on any computer with access to that folder.

To PREVIEW your content, run the "compile.py" script in the content folder.
You'll need to have python installed on your machine for this to work.
Then just open "index.html" in your browser and it should all be there.
Everyone who can see the Dropbox folder can see your changes immediately
after they sync.

To COMMIT your changes appear to the "real" host, you need to run the
recompile_website script on the HOST machine, which is currently the rastr
student account, after the Dropbox has synced.  I might try to make this
more publicly available in the future, but for now, this is what it is.
