I built the original version of this website by hand before I became a software engineer. I have a little nostalgia for it, but frankly it was janky, and I wanted to update it. But the actual management isn't too interesting to me, which means it was a perfect job to throw AI at.

I used AI for:

 - Overhauling the build process
 - Fixing a bunch of "outdated" / "deprecated" warnings in my web code
 - Fixing the layout / UX of the website

I did *not* use AI for:

 - Any of the prose
 - Any of the substantive content
 - This document
