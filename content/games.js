Everything worth noticing is on my GitHub, at <a href=\"https://github.com/rodya-mirov\">https://github.com/rodya-mirov</a>, but most of these are unfinished.  Here some highlights, maybe worth looking at.</p><p>Most of my hobby programming was game development, circa 2011-2012.  Back then XNA was \"over,\" but was still useable and even supported (to an extent). Unfortunately, you'd have trouble compiling it at this point. If you'd like to use the source code or play with the games, you'd have to port it to <a href=\"http://www.monogame.net/\">Monogame</a>.  Fortunately, and very unlike the situation in 2012, Monogame is a mature enough platform that this is a fairly straightforward process.</p><p>Maybe I'll have the time to do it myself one of these days.</p><ul><li><b>Infinite Tile Engine 2D</b> <a href=\"https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Infinite-Tile-Engine-2D\">[link]</a> <br /><p>This is the underlying engine for what was intended to be (but never became) a <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/\">Dwarf Fortress</a> clone.  Yes, that's the best and worst game that's every been made, and yes, like every other hobbyist game programmer, I wanted to be the guy that made \"Dwarf Fortress, but playable.\"  No, it can't be done, and yes, it <a href=\"http://gnomoria.com/\">has been done</a>.  The successes and failures of Gnomoria should be lesson enough, but there will always be proud men who want to unseat their betters.</p><p>More usefully described, this project contains enough information for a procedurally generated (2D) world, in an isometric perspective.  It has support for tilesets, player constructions, function-based landscape, and NPCs (to some degree).  I tried making some games with it; this project was developed simultaneously with <i>Cow Mouse</i>, which was the actual \"game\" (although see above).  If you're interested in using it, fork it; I'm sure that there is functionality you'll need that isn't already there.</p></li><li><b>Voxelist</b> <a href=\"https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Voxelist\">[link]</a> <br /><p>This was like a 3D version of Infinite Tile Engine 2D, but I knew going in that I was only interested in the engine.  It has support for \"infinite\" 3D procedurally generated worlds, and the ability to walk around that world in first person.  The demo projects use some hand-made maps and some maps that use value noise and splines to generate the terrain, along with some graphics that I spent too much time drawing.</p></li><li><b>Frog Defense</b> <a href=\"https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Frog-Defense\">[link]</a> <br /><p>This is a tower defense game <i>with a twist</i> -- instead of building towers along a preordained path, you are given a start and end portal, and you have to dig out the path that the monsters go along.  You have to choose between making more guns or making a longer path (they both cost money), and the balance was I think pretty good.  The art was by yours truly, so it's pretty bad.  It's a complete game, though!  This was made as part of an unofficial 7 Day Game Development Challenge.</p></li></ul><p>I've also done some more \"legitimate\" programming!  This one is still updated:</p><ul><li><b>rodya-mirov.github.io</b> <a href=\"https://github.com/rodya-mirov/rodya-mirov.github.io\">[link]</a> <br /><p>Yup, it's this website!  It's written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, using <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">BootStrap</a>.  It also uses a super, super, super minimalist CMS that I wrote in Python (really, it just reads a list of desired tabs and content, \"compiles\" those HTML pages into JavaScript document.write statements, and populates the main page with them) whose purpose is to avoid code reuse and to prevent loading on the main page.</p></li></ul></p></div>");
