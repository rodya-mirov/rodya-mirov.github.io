This is the homepage of Richard Rast, currently a PhD student in Model Theory at the University of Maryland working under Prof. Chris Laskowski.

<p>
If you're a student of mine looking for information (as of Fall 2015), my office is 0210 in the Math building, and my office hours are on Tuesdays 1-2 and Fridays 11-12, or by appointment (email me).  For anything else: check ELMS!  Virtually everything is on there, and it's updated all the time.  I don't really use this website for teaching, since ELMS is a bit snappier.

If you're looking for information on my research, click the "research" tab (or "talks" or etc.).
