This is the homepage of Richard Rast.  I currently wear several different, but related hats.  I'm a PhD student in Model Theory (a kind of Logic, which is a kind of Math, at least the way I do it).  I'm at the University of Maryland working under Prof. Chris Laskowski.  My thesis is done, my defense is scheduled, and I'm graduating in May!  You can read about my research at the various tabs above.

I'm also a math teacher at that same University.  If you're a student looking for information about a class I'm teaching, you're in the wrong place: check <a href="http://www.elms.umd.edu/">ELMS</a> for homeworks, test dates, your grades, and so on.  Check the syllabus for anything else, but to save you a bit of a trip, my office is Math 0210, I have office hours Tuesday 1-2 and Friday 11-12, and by appointment.  Email me at <a href="mailto:richard.rast@gmail.com">richard.rast@gmail.com</a>.

<p>
I'm also a data scientist!  I'm working at <a href="http://www.bluefinllc.com/">Bluefin</a> to do some top secret development.  Well, it isn't that secret -- given some data about a roof, when is it going to fail?  What if we replace it?  What information is actually useful enough (for this or other purposes) to be worth collecting?  And a thousand other related questions. I can't talk about specifics here of course, so just talk to someone at Bluefin if you're interested in the product.

<p>
Finally, I'm a hobbyist programmer!  I love new technologies and new ideas, especially AI, machine learning, and procedural generation.  You can see some of my older experiments on GitHub (but check out the open source tab); I haven't been able to play with it too much because of the thesis, but I'm going to be getting back into it soon.

PS - My wife, Ran Cui, is a mathematician working in Representation Theory, but starting to lean to the applied side and to data science as well.  Her website is <a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~cuiran/">here</a>.
