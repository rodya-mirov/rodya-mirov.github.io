Most talks I gave are on my research.  Here is a selection of my favorites (except for surprisingly fruitful arguments in and around the beloved student logic seminar at Maryland):
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for Some First Order Theories</b>
		<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
			<i>University of Maryland Logic Seminar</i>, March 29, 2016 <a href="pdf/DefenseSlides.pdf">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Thesis Defense
		</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This covered my thesis!  Except my thesis is 122 pages long, and this talk had an hour.  So it covered the basics of model theory(!), the basics of Borel reducibility, and my two big theorems (outside of potential cardinality): the characterization of o-minimal theories up to Borel reducibility, and the characterization of colored linear orders up to Borel reducibility.  It was aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, rather than specialists, so if you're curious about my research but don't know any logic, this is a good place to start.

			<i>Notre Dame Logic Seminar</i>, December 1, 2015 <a href="pdf/NotreDameTalk.pdf">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk
		</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The aim of these talks was to motivate and define potential cardinality.  This covered Borel reductions, Scott sentences, and back-and-forth equivalence, in order to properly define potential cardinality.  We described some basic results, then used REF as an extended example to demonstrate how it was able to solve new and interesting problems.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Each talk was slightly different, based on my evolving view of how best to present the material, as well as differences in format between the different events and my expectations of how much detail the listeners would want to hear about each topic.

	<li>
	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for Some Ordered Theories</b>
		<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
			<i>Second Vaught's Conjecture Conference</i> at Berkeley, June 1-5, 2015 <a href="pdf/VCCSlides.pdf">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk
		</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This covered the content of the o-minimal and the linear orders paper as a combined theorem and proof (skipping a lot of details so that this is actually possible), as well as hinting at possible generalizations.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Linear Orderings and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b>
		<span style="padding-left: 20px; display: block">
			<i>University of Maryland Logic Seminar</i>, April 14, 2015 <a href="pdf/LinearOrdersComplexitySlides.pdf">[slides]</a></br >75 minutes, Home Talk
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	This covered the main ideas of the linear order paper (above).  It skipped those technical details which are due to M. Rubin, but went through the intuitive part of the argument in significant detail.  It also includes some possible generalizations and parallels between this case and the o-minimal case, with counterexamples to most of the suggested generalizations.

	<li>
	<p><b>Countable Model Theory and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b>
		<span style="padding-left: 20px; display: block">
			<i>CUNY Model Theory Seminar</i>, November 21, 2014 <a href="pdf/Nov21CMT.pdf">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	This was intended as a survey talk on the topic, including motivation, examples of failure of traditional (classification theoretic) methods to handle countable model theory, an introduction to the new (Borel) methods, and some results on o-minimal and omega-stable theories.  It probably covered a bit too much content.

	<p>
	This covers most of the content of the paper with the similar name, but not all, since the work wasn't completely done at that time.

I've also given a few talks for a "general mathematical audience."  Here is my favorite:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>Model Theory and Polynomials</b><br />
		<span style="padding-left:20px; display:block">
			<i>Monroe Martin Spotlight on Graduate Research</i> competition at the University of Maryland, May 8, 2015 <a href="pdf/SpotlightTalk.pdf">[slides]</a><br />10 minutes, (Gold Medal winning) Contest Talk
		</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The goal of the Monroe Martin / Spotlight Competition is to present an interesting or useful idea, theorem, or application from your field to a general mathematical audience ... and do it in ten minutes.  This talk was on Ax's theorem, stating that injective polynomials from $\mathbb{C}^n$ to itself are also surjective.  The logic proof is elegant, short, understandable by non-logicians, and clever -- it uses compactness and completeness of $\textrm{ACF}_p$ to prove statements about $\mathbb{C}$ using the pigeonhole principle on finite fields!  This won a Gold Medal in the competition, meaning a jury of my peers (which had only one logician on it) also found it pretty interesting and approachable.
