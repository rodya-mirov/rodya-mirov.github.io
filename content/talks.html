Most talks I give are on my research.  Here is a selection of my favorites (except for surprisingly fruitful arguments in and around the beloved student logic seminar at Maryland):
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>(title to be announced)</b> for the <i>AMS Special Session on Descriptive Set Theory and its Applications</i> at the University of Utah, April 2016 [upcoming]</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>A New Notion of Cardinality for First Order Theories</b> for the <i>Notre Dame Model Theory Seminar</i>, December 2015 [upcoming]</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for Some Ordered Theories</b> for the <i>Second Vaught's Conjecture Conference</i> at Berkeley, June 2015 <a href="pdf/VCCSlides">[slides]</a></p>
	
	<p>
	This covered the content of the o-minimal and the linear orders paper as a combined theorem and proof (skipping a lot of details so that this is actually possible), as well as hinting at possible generalizations.  This was a one-hour invited talk at the Second Vaught's Conjecture Conference at Berkeley on June 4, 2015.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Linear Orderings and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b> for the <i>University of Maryland Logic Seminar</i>, April 2015 <a href="pdf/LinearOrdersComplexitySlides.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This covered the main ideas of the linear order paper (above).  It skipped those technical details which are due to M. Rubin, but went through the intuitive part of the argument in significant detail.  It also includes some possible generalizations and parallels between this case and the o-minimal case, with counterexamples to most of the suggested generalizations.  It was given as a seventy-five minute talk at the University of Maryland on April 14, 2015.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><b>Countable Model Theory and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b> for the <i>CUNY Model Theory Seminar</i>, November 2014 <a href="pdf/Nov21CMT.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This was intended as a survey talk on the topic, including motivation, examples of failure of traditional (classification theoretic) methods to handle countable model theory, an introduction to the new (Borel) methods, and some results on o-minimal and omega-stable theories.  It probably covered a bit too much content.  It was given as a one hour invited talk at the CUNY graduate center on November 21, 2014.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Borel Complete O-Minimal Theories</b> for the <i>ASL North America Meeting</i>, May 2014 <a href="pdf/BorelCompleteOMinimalSlides.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This covers most of the content of the paper with the similar name, but not all, since the work wasn't completely done at that time.  This was given as a 15 minute contributed talk to the ASL on May 20, 2014.
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I've also given a few talks for a "general mathematical audience."  Here is my favorite:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>Model Theory and Polynomials</b> for the <i>Monroe Martin Spotlight on Graduate Research</i> competition at the University of Maryland, May 2015 <a href="pdf/SpotlightTalk.pdf">[slides]</a></p>
	
	<p>
	The goal of the Monroe Martin / Spotlight Competition is to present an interesting or useful idea, theorem, or application from your field to a general mathematical audience ... and do it in ten minutes.  This talk was on Ax's theorem, stating that injective polynomials from $\mathbb{C}^n$ to itself are also surjective.  The logic proof is elegant, short, understandable by non-logicians, and clever -- it uses compactness and completeness of $\textrm{ACF}_p$ to prove statements about $\mathbb{C}$ using the pigeonhole principle on finite fields!  This won a Gold Medal in the competition, meaning a jury of my peers (which had only one logician on it) also found it pretty interesting and approachable.
