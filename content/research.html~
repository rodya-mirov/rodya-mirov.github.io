I am working in the area of mathematical logic known as model theory.  Approximately, this means I try to figure out, given a set of statements (a theory), what kind of structures (models) exist that satisfy those statements?  Can we classify them?  Can we show such a classification is impossible?  Like everything else in math, "model theory" is a wide tent, and means a lot of different things to different people.

My current interest is in the Borel complexity of first-order theories (that is, the isomorphism relation on the space of countable models of such a theory).  This can be understood by analogy: given a set of structures, how difficult must a "general algorithm" be to determine if two structures from that set are isomorphic?  The notion of "Borel reductions" is only a useful way to make that imprecise notion into something precise, but it's a well-behaved notion that lines up well with our intuition.

I have written two papers on this topic, both of which are intended to be part of my thesis:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for O-Minimal Theories</b>, <i>Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> (submitted August 2014) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5876">[arXiv]</a></p>

	<p>This classified the Borel complexity of isomorphism for all countable o-minimal theories, based on a few model-theoretic invariants.  If the theory admits a nonsimple type (a concept invented by Laura Mayer), the theory is Borel complete.  Otherwise, its complexity is very low, depending entirely on the number of independent nonisolated 1-types.  Specifically, it's equality on countable sets of reals (if there are uncountably many), or equality on a Polish space with cardinality equal to the number of countable models (if there are only countably many).  This work uses builds on the ideas of Dave Sahota's unpublished 2013 PhD thesis, so he is listed as a co-author of this paper.

	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for Colored Linear Orders</b> <a href="pdf/LOBC.pdf">[pdf]</a></p>

	<p>
	This classified the Borel complexity of isomorphism for all colored linear orders (that is, a linear order with countably many unary predicates added), based on a few model-theoretic invariants.  If the theory admits a non-$\aleph_0$-categorical interval type, the theory is Borel complete.  Otherwise, its complexity is very low, depending entirely on the number of nonisolated 1-types.  Specifically, it's equality on countable sets of reals (if there are uncountably many), or equality on a Polish space with cardinality equal to the number of countable models (if there are only countably many).  This work closely follows Rubin's work on colored linear orders, where he defined self-additivity and proved Vaught's conjecture (among other things) for such theories.

I've also given a few talks on this topic:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>Borel Complete O-Minimal Theories</b> for the <i>ASL North America Meeting</i>, May 2014 <a href="pdf/BorelCompleteOMinimalSlides.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This covers most of the content of the paper with the similar name, but not all, since the work wasn't completely done at that time.  This was given as a 15 minute contributed talk to the ASL on May 20, 2014.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Countable Model Theory and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b> for the <i>CUNY Model Theory Seminar</i>, November 2014 <a href="pdf/Nov21CMT.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This was intended as a survey talk on the topic, including motivation, examples of failure of traditional (classification theoretic) methods to handle countable model theory, an introduction to the new (Borel) methods, and some results on o-minimal and omega-stable theories.  It probably covered a bit too much content.  It was given as a one hour invited talk at the CUNY graduate center on November 21, 2014.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Linear Orderings and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b> for the <i>University of Maryland Logic Seminar</i>, April 2015 <a href="pdf/LinearOrdersComplexitySlides.pdf">[slides]</a></p>

	<p>
	This covered the main ideas of the linear order paper (above).  It skipped those technical details which are due to M. Rubin, but went through the intuitive part of the argument in significant detail.  It also includes some possible generalizations and parallels between this case and the o-minimal case, with counterexamples to most of the suggested generalizations.  It was given as a seventy-five minute talk at the University of Maryland on April 14, 2015.
