As a mathematician, I work in the area of mathematical logic known as model theory.  Approximately, this means I try to figure out, given a set of statements (a theory), what kind of structures (models) exist that satisfy those statements?  Can we classify them?  Can we show such a classification is impossible?  Like everything else in math, "model theory" is a wide tent, and means a lot of different things to different people.
</p>

<p>
My current interest is in the Borel complexity of first-order theories (that is, the isomorphism relation on the space of countable models of such a theory).  This can be understood by analogy: given a set of structures, how difficult must a "general algorithm" be to determine if two structures from that set are isomorphic?  The notion of "Borel reductions" is only a useful way to make that imprecise notion into something precise, but it's a well-behaved notion that lines up well with our intuition.

I have written two papers on "positive results" in this area; that is, times when we can get some kind of classification. Both of which are part of my thesis:

	<p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for O-Minimal Theories</b>, <i>Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> (to appear) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5876">[arXiv]</a>.  With Dave Sahota.</p>

	<p>This classified the Borel complexity of isomorphism for all countable o-minimal theories, based on a few model-theoretic invariants.  If the theory admits a nonsimple type (a concept invented by Laura Mayer), the theory is Borel complete.  Otherwise, its complexity is very low, depending entirely on the number of independent nonisolated 1-types.  Specifically, it's equality on countable sets of reals (if there are uncountably many), or equality on a Polish space with cardinality equal to the number of countable models (if there are only countably many).  This work uses builds on the ideas of Dave Sahota's unpublished 2013 PhD thesis, so to honor that, the paper is to be published as joint work between the two of us.

	This classified the Borel complexity of isomorphism for all colored linear orders (that is, a linear order with countably many unary predicates added), based on a few model-theoretic invariants.  If the theory admits a non-$\aleph_0$-categorical interval type, the theory is Borel complete.  Otherwise, its complexity is very low, depending entirely on the number of nonisolated 1-types.  Specifically, it's equality on countable sets of reals (if there are uncountably many), or equality on a Polish space with cardinality equal to the number of countable models (if there are only countably many).  We also investigated the number of back-and-forth inequivalent models for such theories, and determined the counts lined up exactly with the associated Borel complexity.  This work builds on Rubin's work on colored linear orders, where he defined self-additivity and proved Vaught's conjecture (among other things) for such theories.

On a slightly different topic, but heavily related, is the following question. To show one thing reduces to another, you basically just write down the map.  This can be very difficult, obviously, but the goal is ultimately as clear as the objects themselves.  But suppose you really <i>can't</i> reduce one thing to another.  How on earth do you prove that?

	<p><b>A New Notion of Cardinality for Countable First Order Theories</b>, <i>Transactions of the AMS</i> (submitted 2015) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05679">[arXiv]</a>.  With Douglas Ulrich (first author) and Chris Laskowski.</p>
	
	<p>
	The goal of this paper (from my perspective; my co-authors might summarize this differently) is to give new tools to show the <i>nonexistence</i> of a Borel reduction, as this is incredibly difficult in general, especially when the isorphism relations of the associated theories are not Borel.  To this end we were able to define a "potential cardinality" of a theory, $\|T\|$, where if $T_1$ is Borel reducible to $T_2$, then $\|T_1\|\leq \|T_2\|$. 	This cardinality is the number of "formally consistent, canonical Scott sentences" which imply $T$; in particular this includes the "Scott sentences" of uncountable models of $T$, as well as (in some cases) sentences which have no models, but which do have models in forcing extensions.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Surprisingly, $\|T\|$ can often be computed directly, allowing us to give several examples of first-order theories which are not Borel complete but whose isomorphism relations are not Borel.  This can happen for a variety of reasons and, if I may plug my own work, I think the first few sections are pretty readable and definitely worth a look.  This is joint work with Douglas Ulrich and Chris Laskowski; in particular many of the best set-theoretic ideas come from Douglas.

My thesis contains all the information from the o-minimal paper and the linear orders paper, along with slight extensions of both theorems and a somewhat combined approach to both.  It also includes a reasonably large class of examples, not present in the original papers, which may help the reader to understand why certain cases exist (especially for the o-minimal chapter).  Finally, the introduction chapter is much longer and more in-depth than in either of those papers, and even includes a summary of the tools in the potential cardinality paper.  The exposition is quite different, although I think both approaches are good.  If you're interested, take a look!
