Here is a selection of my favorites (except for surprisingly fruitful arguments in and around the beloved student logic seminar at Maryland):<ul><li><p><b>Some Results on the Countable Model Theory of $\\aleph_0$-stable Theories</b><br /><i>ASL North America Meeting</i>, May 23-26, 2016 <a href=\"pdf/BorelCompleteOMinimalSlides.pdf\">[slides]</a><br />15 minutes, Contributed Talk</p></li><p>The aim of this talk will be to describe <i>at a high level</i> what ENI types are, then what ENI-DOP and ENI-depth are, in terms of decompositions of models.  Then, at a very rough level, to describe Laskowski and Shelah's theorem that if $T$ is ENI-DOP or ENI-deep, then $T$ is Borel complete (and more), and from there to describe my results along the same lines for $T$ which are ENI-NDOP and ENI-shallow.  Lots of pictures.</p><li><p><b>(title to be announced)</b><br /><i>AMS Special Session on Descriptive Set Theory and its Applications</i> at the University of Utah, April 9-10, 2016 [upcoming]<br />20 minutes, Invited Talk</p></li><li><p><b>(title to be announced)</b><br /><i>Penn State Logic Seminar</i>, March 22, 2016 [upcoming]<br />60 minutes, Invited Talk</p></li><li><p><b>(title to be announced)</b><br /><i>CUNY Model Theory Seminar</i>, March 4, 2016 [upcoming]<br />60 minutes, Invited Talk</p></li><li><p><b>A New Notion of Cardinality for First Order Theories</b><br /><i>Notre Dame Logic Seminar</i>, December 1, 2015 <a href=\"pdf/NotreDameTalk\">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk</p><p>The aim of this talk was to motivate and define potential cardinality, then talk about REF as an extended worked example.</p></li><li><p><b>The Borel Complexity of Isomorphism for Some Ordered Theories</b><br /><i>Second Vaught's Conjecture Conference</i> at Berkeley, June 1-5, 2015 <a href=\"pdf/VCCSlides\">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk</p><p>This covered the content of the o-minimal and the linear orders paper as a combined theorem and proof (skipping a lot of details so that this is actually possible), as well as hinting at possible generalizations.</p></li><li><p><b>Linear Orderings and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b><br /><i>University of Maryland Logic Seminar</i>, April 14, 2015 <a href=\"pdf/LinearOrdersComplexitySlides.pdf\">[slides]</a></br >75 minutes</p><p>This covered the main ideas of the linear order paper (above).  It skipped those technical details which are due to M. Rubin, but went through the intuitive part of the argument in significant detail.  It also includes some possible generalizations and parallels between this case and the o-minimal case, with counterexamples to most of the suggested generalizations.</p></li><li><p><b>Countable Model Theory and the Complexity of Isomorphism</b><br /><i>CUNY Model Theory Seminar</i>, November 21, 2014 <a href=\"pdf/Nov21CMT.pdf\">[slides]</a><br />60 minutes, Invited Talk</p><p>This was intended as a survey talk on the topic, including motivation, examples of failure of traditional (classification theoretic) methods to handle countable model theory, an introduction to the new (Borel) methods, and some results on o-minimal and omega-stable theories.  It probably covered a bit too much content.</p></li><li><p><b>Borel Complete O-Minimal Theories</b><br /><i>ASL North America Meeting</i>, May 19-22, 2014 <a href=\"pdf/BorelCompleteOMinimalSlides.pdf\">[slides]</a><br />15 minutes, Contributed Talk</p><p>This covers most of the content of the paper with the similar name, but not all, since the work wasn't completely done at that time.</p></li></ul></p><p style=\"padding-top:30px\">I've also given a few talks for a \"general mathematical audience.\"  Here is my favorite:<ul><li><p><b>Model Theory and Polynomials</b><br /><i>Monroe Martin Spotlight on Graduate Research</i> competition at the University of Maryland, May 8, 2015 <a href=\"pdf/SpotlightTalk.pdf\">[slides]</a><br />20 minutes, (Gold Medal winning) Contest Talk</p><p>The goal of the Monroe Martin / Spotlight Competition is to present an interesting or useful idea, theorem, or application from your field to a general mathematical audience ... and do it in ten minutes.  This talk was on Ax's theorem, stating that injective polynomials from $\\mathbb{C}^n$ to itself are also surjective.  The logic proof is elegant, short, understandable by non-logicians, and clever -- it uses compactness and completeness of $\\textrm{ACF}_p$ to prove statements about $\\mathbb{C}$ using the pigeonhole principle on finite fields!  This won a Gold Medal in the competition, meaning a jury of my peers (which had only one logician on it) also found it pretty interesting and approachable.</p></li></ul></p></div>");
