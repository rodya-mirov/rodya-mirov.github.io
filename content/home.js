For anything else: check ELMS!  Virtually everything is on there, and it's updated all the time.  I don't really use this website for teaching, since ELMS is a bit snappier.</p><p>If you're looking for information on my research, click the \"research\" tab (or \"talks\" or etc.).<p><p>If you're hoping to contact me, email is best: try <a href=\"mailto:richard.rast@gmail.com\">richard.rast@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for pictures of rabbits, you're in the right place!</p></div>");
