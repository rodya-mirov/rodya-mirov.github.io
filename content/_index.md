## Richard Rast

This is the homepage of Richard Rast.  I've worn a lot of different hats recently, which are all at least a little related.  I was a mathematician in Model Theory (which is a kind of Logic, which is a kind of Math, at least the way I do it).  I got my PhD at the University of Maryland, under the advisement of Prof. Chris Laskowski.  You can read about my research at the appropriate tabs above.

I was also a math teacher at the University of Maryland, from 2009 to 2016.  Syllabi, course notes, and other information are available at [ELMS](http://www.elms.umd.edu/), although as time goes on, these links will go dead.

I'm also a software engineer at [TriNetX](http://trinetx.com/)! I'm strictly backend though, so don't hold my website against them.

Finally, I'm a hobbyist programmer.  I love new technologies and new ideas, especially AI, machine learning, and procedural generation.  You can see some of my older experiments on GitHub (check out the open source tab). More recently my hobby time has been taken up by [Project Euler](projecteuler.net/). They ask users not to share solutions, so you won't see any of that on Github.

PS - My wife, Ran Cui, is a mathematician. She got her PhD in Representation Theory, and is currently a Postdoc at MIT with the [Atlas of Lie Groups](http://www.liegroups.org/) project, as well as a Visiting Scholar at Harvard SPH, working in statistical genetics (wow!).  Her website is [here](http://www.math.umd.edu/~cuiran/).
