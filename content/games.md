In my spare time in grad school and now the world of work, I've done some other programming.  Everything worth noticing is on my GitHub, at [https://github.com/rodya-mirov](https://github.com/rodya-mirov), but most of these are unfinished.  Here some highlights, maybe worth looking at.

Most of my spare-time programming these days is in the field of machine learning (or data science, depending on who's asking and what they want from me). I can't show anything proprietary, but some of it is opened up and free to display.

- **Shallow Minds** [link](https://github.com/rodya-mirov/shallow-minds)
        
    This project is a short "course" on artificial neural networks. All the code is in python (using numpy) but otherwise requires no external software. It's written as a series of Jupyter notebooks, meaning you can jump in and edit, experiment, and generally make it your own, right from the start.  It aims to be crystal clear, so that anyone interested can understand it. It has lots of sample code (as simple as possible!) so that anyone can reproduce it and improve on it. And it is modern enough and current enough on the literature that what you learn is actually useful.
        
    This started as my own notes, building up a little starter code so I could see how every technique worked and how it interacted with others, but I realized that with some polish, it could be useful to other people, too.  I hope that turns out to be true.
        
    This project is still under development when I have time, but even at this stage I think it could be useful.

In my earlier days, circa 2011-2012, I did a lot of independent game development, although most of it was for my own enjoyment and nothing ever went to market.  Back then XNA was "over," but was still useable and even supported (to an extent). Unfortunately, you'd have trouble compiling it at this point. If you'd like to use the source code or play with the games, you'd have to port it to [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/).  Fortunately, and very unlike the situation in 2012, Monogame is a mature enough platform that this is a fairly straightforward process.

Maybe I'll have the time to do it myself one of these days.

- **Infinite Tile Engine 2D** [link](https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Infinite-Tile-Engine-2D)
		
    This is the underlying engine for what was intended to be (but never became) a [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) clone.  Yes, that's the best and worst game that's every been made, and yes, like every other hobbyist game programmer, I wanted to be the guy that made "Dwarf Fortress, but playable."  No, it can't be done, and yes, it [has been done](http://gnomoria.com/).  The successes and failures of Gnomoria should be lesson enough, but there will always be proud men who want to unseat their betters.
		
    More usefully described, this project contains enough information for a procedurally generated (2D) world, in an isometric perspective.  It has support for tilesets, player constructions, function-based landscape, and NPCs (to some degree).  I tried making some games with it; this project was developed simultaneously with *Cow Mouse*, which was the actual "game" (although see above).  If you're interested in using it, fork it; I'm sure that there is functionality you'll need that isn't already there.
	
- **Voxelist** [link](https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Voxelist)
		
    This was like a 3D version of Infinite Tile Engine 2D, but I knew going in that I was only interested in the engine.  It has support for "infinite" 3D procedurally generated worlds, and the ability to walk around that world in first person.  The demo projects use some hand-made maps and some maps that use value noise and splines to generate the terrain, along with some graphics that I spent too much time drawing.
	
- **Frog Defense** [link](https://github.com/rodya-mirov/Frog-Defense)
		
    This is a tower defense game *with a twist* -- instead of building towers along a preordained path, you are given a start and end portal, and you have to dig out the path that the monsters go along.  You have to choose between making more guns or making a longer path (they both cost money), and the balance was I think pretty good.  The art was by yours truly, so it's pretty bad.  It's a complete game, though!  This was made as part of an unofficial 7 Day Game Development Challenge.
